# Goal

To train single object detection models from scratch on commmonly available datasets and make them available them in small enough packages so that they can be deployed easily.
Add deployemnt scripts with FastAPI, TfJS, TFLite and TFMicro. Also provide option to train object detetcors using any subset of categories available in these datasets

# Available detectors

- Person
    - Use cases include people counter pedestrian detection
- Automobile
    - For lience plate detection
- Animals
- Objects
## Datasets

PASCAL
MS COCO 
GOOGLE OPEN IMAGES

## Models

YOLO
YOLO v2
YOLO v3

mobile net SSD
retina Net
